Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning 

This project is a DQLAB project. The purpose of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning. Based on the modeling that has been done using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost, it can be concluded that the best model to predict customer churn is using Logistic Regression. This is because the performance of the Logistic Regression model tends to predict equally well in the training and testing phases, while other models tend to over-fit in performance.
