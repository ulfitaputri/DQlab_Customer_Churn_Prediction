**Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project is from the industrial applicationts class at Academy DQLAB. 

The purpose of this project is to predict customer churn at DQlab Telco using machine learning. 

**Project Steps**
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Perform Data Pre-Processing
3. Modeling Machine Learning
4. Determining the Best Model

The best model will be saved as best_model_churn.pkl file for model deployment purposes.

This is a demo of customer churn prediction on dqlab telco
